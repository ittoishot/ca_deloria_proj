	<h1>About me</h1>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<p><img src="C:\Users\paler\Desktop\Grade 9\ca_deloria_aa1\images\me.jpg" class="me">Hello to those who are reading this! My name is Mark Joseph A. Deloria. I'm 15 years old but turning 16 years old on March of 2022. As for my name, they said it came from saints Mark and Joseph. I'm from Barangay Baliok in Dumoy, Davao City. There are 5 of us in the family, my mother, father and 2 other siblings. I'm the youngest among us 3 siblings. I'm not sure if this is a trivia, but back then it was our Intrams day and I was the only one who scored for our team because all of us were bad at playing.</p><br><p style="text-indent: 50px;">This topic actually came from English class. We were asked to write paragraphs for our chosen topics and I chose Shopping. I then used this topic for my CS project. Why shopping? Well, I'm sure it's not a major issue the world is facing but differentiating methods of shopping is kind of helpful. I also discussed in my project the advantages and disadvantages of 2 different methods of shopping. By including the advantages and disadvantages in the project, it will bring more information to people and this could possibly help them decide which method to use.</p><br><p style="text-indent: 50px;">I hope that in the future there will be lesser scams when it comes to shopping. It's because you spend your money and then when you get scammed you just wasted your money. I'm hoping that young people know about the risks of shopping especially shopping online. Lastly, I hope shopping online will be much safer. As for traditional shopping, I think it's good already.</p>
